Coding time: 81 min. ( my first time setting the stopwatch :) )
We have an image with a question text and two buttons labeled 'True' and 'False.' You answer the question, and an alert will show whether you are correct or not. Once all questions have been answered, a user score alert will appear, and the questions will reset to start over.
